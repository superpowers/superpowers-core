### Powerful, extensible, collaborative game development.

Superpowers is a downloadable HTML5 app. You can use it solo like a regular offline game maker,
or setup a password and let friends join in on your project through their Web browser.
It's great for working together over long periods of time, for jamming over a weekend,
or just for helping each other out with debugging!

#### ... not just for making games!

We've built the [Superpowers Game](https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-game) engine and a bunch of asset editors to make games with TypeScript.
But the coolest thing is this: Superpowers itself is actually engine-agnostic.
It's just a piece of software for collaborating on projects and you can extend it with project types and editors.

Use Superpowers to make [static websites](http://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-web), [Lua LÖVE games](https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-love2d), slideshows, blogs, movies...
whatever you can come up with!
